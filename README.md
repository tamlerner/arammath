# 🌟 A non-dev journey 🌟

👋 Hey, I’m Tam – currently on a full-ride at Veris Labs, CYTO, **SheFi**, learning to code a little with **React.js** ⚛️ and **Tailwind CSS** 🎨, because apparently, that's what the cool kids do these days.


## 💼 Real World Stuff:
I’m the **Chief of Operations at CYTO** and **Director of Operations at Veris Labs** (aka **Unlockd** and **maxAPY**). Basically, I combine tech and finance to make things that last longer than your average crypto hype cycle.



## 🔭 What I’m *Supposedly* Working On:
- **React.js** – Making things dynamic, because static pages are for people who don’t like fun.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Trying to make things look pretty while keeping the headache to a minimum.


## 🌱 What I’m Still Trying to Learn:
- **JavaScript frameworks** – because one framework is never enough, apparently.
- **Advanced CSS and UI/UX** – trying to make things usable *and* good-looking. Spoiler: it's hard.
- **Blockchain and Fintech** – still figuring out if it’s the future or just a really complicated way to lose money.
